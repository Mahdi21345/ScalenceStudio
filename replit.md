# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**, utilizing a modern component-based architecture. The application uses **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds. The UI is constructed with **shadcn/ui** components built on top of **Radix UI** primitives, providing accessible and customizable interface elements.

**Styling**: The application uses **Tailwind CSS** with a custom design system featuring CSS variables for theming. The design implements a professional gradient-based color scheme with purple/violet accents and supports both light and dark modes.

**Routing**: Client-side routing is handled by **Wouter**, a lightweight routing library that provides simple navigation between pages.

**Animations**: **Framer Motion** is integrated for smooth animations and transitions throughout the user interface.

## Backend Architecture
The server is built with **Express.js** and TypeScript, following a RESTful API pattern. The architecture separates concerns with dedicated modules for routing, storage, and server configuration.

**API Structure**: The backend exposes contact management endpoints (`/api/contacts`) for creating and retrieving contact submissions. Form validation is handled using **Zod** schemas to ensure data integrity.

**Storage Layer**: Currently implements an in-memory storage solution (`MemStorage`) with an interface-based design that allows for easy migration to persistent database solutions.

## Data Management
**State Management**: The application uses **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management, providing caching, synchronization, and optimistic updates for API interactions.

**Form Handling**: Forms are managed with **React Hook Form** combined with Zod resolvers for robust validation and type safety.

**Database Schema**: Prepared for PostgreSQL integration with Drizzle ORM, featuring a contacts table schema with fields for name, email, phone, company, message, contact type, and timestamps.

## Development and Build Process
**Development**: The application supports hot module replacement in development with integrated error handling through Replit-specific plugins.

**Build Process**: Production builds are created using Vite for the frontend and esbuild for the backend, with separate output directories for optimized deployment.

**Deployment Preparation**: Static deployment compatibility is ensured through deployment preparation scripts that restructure build output from `dist/public/` to `dist/` format, placing `index.html` at the root level as required by static hosting platforms.

**Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript configuration ensures type safety across the entire application with shared types between frontend and backend.
