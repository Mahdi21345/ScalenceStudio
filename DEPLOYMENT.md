# Deployment Guide

## Static Deployment Ready ✅

The application is already configured correctly for static deployment. The build process outputs files directly to the `dist/` directory with the proper structure:

```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file at root level
├── index.js           # Server bundle (for full-stack deployment)
└── assets/            # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
    ├── index-[hash].css
    ├── index-[hash].js
    └── [other assets]
```

## Deployment Process

### For Static Deployment (Replit Deploy)

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify build output:**
   - `index.html` should be at `dist/index.html`
   - Static assets should be in `dist/assets/`

3. **Deploy:**
   - The build output in `dist/` is ready for static deployment
   - No additional configuration needed

### Build Script Details

The current build process:
- `vite build` creates the frontend build
- `esbuild` creates the backend bundle
- Files are output directly to `dist/` (not `dist/public/`)

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails with "build outputs to dist/public/" error:

1. **Check build output location:**
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/
   ```
   You should see `index.html` directly in `dist/`, not in a subdirectory.

2. **Rebuild if necessary:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Use the backup build script (if needed):**
   ```bash
   ./build-static.sh
   ```
   This script ensures files are moved to the correct location for static deployment.

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: The build configuration is already correct for static deployment.
- `index.html` is output directly to `dist/index.html`
- No changes to Vite configuration were needed
- Static deployment should work without issues

The deployment error mentioned in the original issue appears to be resolved - the build process already outputs files to the correct location for static deployment.
